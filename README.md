# Advent of Code 2021 (Go)

This project includes an implementation of the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) problems, implemented in Go.

These are ports from my [C# solutions](https://github.com/bradwilson/advent-2021), which I do on live stream: [Advent of Code 2021 Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtiSGQKEdIWyo-YzKDRyElkxCqyeB9lrk)

_Note: I'm not well versed enough in Go to know whether these are canonical Go style, so apologies in advance if you're here to learn correct style! This is the wrong place for that._ üòÅ
